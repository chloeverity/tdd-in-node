### About

In this project, I was looking at:
* unit testing in Node using the Mocha framework (/Chai)
* using stubs and spies from the Sinon library
* testing asynchronous code in Mocha
* writing unit tests for a module that makes an HTTP request
* using Nock to fake out HTTP requests made from Node

### Testing

run the tests with:

```
mocha tests --recursive --expose-internals
```

to ensure that the tests don't hang
